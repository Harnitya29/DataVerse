# Team Entropy – Datathon 2026

## Problem Statement
What structural factors drive national resilience during systemic shocks such as pandemics?

## Objective
To evaluate whether digital readiness and green transition performance influence resilience more strongly than traditional economic size indicators like GDP.

## Dataset
Cross-country governance and public policy dataset including:
- GDP
- Income Group
- Digital Readiness Score
- Green Transition Score
- Human Development Index
- Resilience Index
- Pandemic Year Indicator (2020)

## Methodology
1. Data Cleaning and preprocessing
2. Feature engineering (log GDP, pandemic flag, interaction analysis)
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (correlation, distribution analysis)
4. Linear Regression modeling
5. Comparative modeling (with and without GDP)

## Key Findings
- Digital readiness shows a strong positive association with resilience.
- Green transition performance contributes significantly to structural stability.
- GDP alone does not sufficiently explain resilience variation.
- Structural adaptability matters more than economic size during crises.

## Policy Implication
Governments aiming to increase national resilience should prioritize digital infrastructure and sustainable transition policies rather than focusing solely on economic expansion.
